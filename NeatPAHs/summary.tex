Representative Values From Literature:
\begin{itemize}
    \item{PE Mobility: 2E-1 (one paper reports 5E2)}
    \item{PT Mobility: 8E-1}
\end{itemize}

Comments:
\begin{itemize}
    \item{The mobilities reported here vary significantly, but generally have good experimental agreeement}
    \item{As expected, the eclipsed systems \textbf{1}, \textbf{2} and \textbf{6} generally have higher anisotropies than their comparable ordered systems.
        This is due to a higher degree of order along the stack, which makes it easier for carriers to travel along the stack, resulting in more anisotropic transport.}
    \item{However, this trend is only the case for the single-stack systems, where the columns pack off the simulation volume axes.
        This means, due to periodic boundary conditions, that the simulation volume actually only contains a single stack as carriers can `hop to adjacent stacks' by simply continuing along the current one.}
    \item{The discrepancy between the off-axis single-stack systems (\textbf{2}, \textbf{3}, \textbf{6}) and the along-axis multiple-stack systems (\textbf{1}, \textbf{4}, \textbf{5}) is visible in the comparisons of the perylothiophene systems.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item{Anisotropy is significantly lower in the eclipsed case (\textbf{4} compared to \textbf{6}) when multiple stacks are present, compared to a single stack.
                    This could partially be a result of the slight herringbone structure observed in the multiple-stack systems increasing the transfer integrals to neighbouring stacks, permitting more parity between transport along- and between-stacks.}
                \item{Mobility is also lessened by at least an order of magnitude.
                    This again could result from the herringbone structure which forces neighbouring molecules within a stack slightly further apart to accomodate the alternating orientations of molecules between stacks.}
            \end{itemize}
        }
    \item{The perylene systems \textbf{1} and \textbf{2} do not exhibit the above behaviour - the mobility trend is reversed (the single-stack mobility in \textbf{2} is two orders of magnitude slower than the multi-stack mobility of \textbf{1}).
            This reinforces the idea that the difference between the single- and multi-stack cases is a factor of the herringbone-like packing observed in perylothiophene, as the perylene systems do not exhibit the same herringbone-like structure.
        \textcolor{red}{What is the reason for the two order of magnitude discrepancy in the mobility then, if neither system exhibits herringbone packing?}}

\begin{figure}[h!]\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figures/3dHole.pdf}
    \caption{The 3D heatmap of charge transport routes within the morphologies \textbf{1} - \textbf{7}.
    Dark routes describe commonly accessed hops between pairs of chromophores, whereas pale routes are less widely used in the KMC simulations.
    Each node therefore represents the location of a single chromophore.
The intensity value for the route is currently taken to be \texttt{I $=$ np.log10(freq) $/$ np.log10(max\_freq)}.}

\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
    \item{These are among the best fits we've ever had with MorphCT.}
    \item{The `odd one out' here is \textbf{5}, which exhibits slight saturation leading to a poorer fit.}
    \item{Fitting parameters have r values of > 99.999\%, except for \textbf{5} which has r = 97.29\%}

	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figures/DonorHoppingRateMixed.pdf}
    \caption{The hopping-rate distributions for hops executed by carriers within the morphologies \textbf{1} - \textbf{7}.
    \textcolor{red}{It would require some pretty clever ad-hoc code, but it would be really nice to split this into intra- and inter-stack hops!}}
	\label{fig:HoppingRateMixed}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
    \item{The hopping rate distributions vary quite a lot! Some are single-mode, others bimodal, and one is tri-modal.}
    \item{I will make more comments here after I've made the code mentioned above where we compare intra- to inter-stack hops}
